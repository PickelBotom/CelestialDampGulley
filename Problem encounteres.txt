Tile sheet kept breaking when import diffirent types of tiles.
original tyles were 16 x 16 bits and the new ones were 8 x 8
realised the 2 types werent compatable and would make the 16 x 16 tiles enlarge and break.
Created a seperate tylesheet for the 8 x 8 tiles.

Unity Github issue.
Unity project was not being comitted to github repo.
Had to add unity project to tracked files with git add Testing-Area/
